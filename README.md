## üìç Usage Examples

### Adding a Mintable Zone with Dynamic Pricing
```clarity
(contract-call? .geonova add-mintable-zone 
  u1                    ;; zone-id
  "Times Square NYC"    ;; name
  404852000             ;; latitude * 10^7
  -739776000            ;; longitude * 10^7
  u100                  ;; 100 meter radius
  u1000                 ;; max 1000 mints
  u1000000              ;; base price (1 STX)
  u150                  ;; popularity multiplier (1.5x)
  true                  ;; enable-time-pricing
  u100                  ;; special event multiplier (1.0x default)
)
```

### Setting Up Pricing Tiers
```clarity
;; Tier 1: After 100 mints, price increases by 1.5x
(contract-call? .geonova set-pricing-tier u1 u1 u100 u150)

;; Tier 2: After 500 mints, price increases by 2x
(contract-call? .geonova set-pricing-tier u1 u2 u500 u200)

;; Tier 3: After 800 mints, price increases by 3x
(contract-call? .geonova set-pricing-tier u1 u3 u800 u300)
```

### Configuring Time-Based Pricing
```clarity
;; Peak hours (9 AM): 2x multiplier
(contract-call? .geonova set-time-based-pricing u1 u9 u200)

;; Lunch hour (12 PM): 1.5x multiplier
(contract-call? .geonova set-time-based-pricing u1 u12 u150)

;; Off-peak (3 AM): 0.5x multiplier
(contract-call? .geonova set-time-based-pricing u1 u3 u50)
```

### Minting an NFT (User pays calculated price)
```clarity
(contract-call? .geonova mint-location-nft 
  u1 
  404852050             ;; User's latitude
  -739775950            ;; User's longitude
  "ipfs://QmHash..."    ;; Metadata URI
)
```

### Checking Current Price
```clarity
(contract-call? .geonova get-current-mint-price u1)
```

## üíé Pricing Algorithm

The final mint price is calculated as:
```
Final Price = Base Price √ó (Popularity Multiplier √ó Time Multiplier √ó Event Multiplier) √∑ 10,000
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Base Price: 1 STX (1,000,000 microSTX)
- Popularity Multiplier: 150% (150)
- Time Multiplier: 200% (200) 
- Event Multiplier: 100% (100)
- Final Price: 1,000,000 √ó (150 √ó 200 √ó 100) √∑ 10,000 √∑ 100 = 3 STX

## üîí Security Features

- **Coordinate Validation**: Ensures valid GPS coordinates
- **Access Control**: Owner-only administrative functions
- **Cooldown Protection**: Prevents spam minting
- **Zone Verification**: Confirms user location within zone radius
- **Duplicate Prevention**: One mint per user per zone
- **Payment Security**: STX transfer validation and error handling
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking for all pricing inputs

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Tourism**: Collect NFTs from famous landmarks with premium pricing
- **Conferences**: Event attendance verification with time-sensitive pricing
- **Art Installations**: Location-specific art pieces with dynamic valuation
- **Gaming**: Real-world treasure hunts with escalating rewards
- **Marketing**: Location-based promotional campaigns with surge pricing
- **Peak Hour Events**: Higher prices during busy periods
- **Discovery Incentives**: Lower prices for off-the-beaten-path locations

## üìà Contract Architecture

The contract uses efficient data structures with enhanced pricing capabilities:
- `mintable-zones`: Zone configuration including pricing parameters
- `zone-pricing-tiers`: Popularity-based pricing tiers
- `time-based-pricing`: Hourly pricing multipliers
- `location-nfts`: NFT ownership, metadata, and mint price records
- `user-last-mint`: Cooldown tracking
- `zone-user-mints`: Per-zone minting records

# GeoNova Future Feature Roadmap üöÄ

## 1. ‚úÖ **Dynamic Pricing Zones** (IMPLEMENTED)
Variable minting costs based on zone popularity, time of day, or special events. Premium locations command higher prices while incentivizing discovery of lesser-known areas.

## 2. **Multi-Signature Zone Creation**
Add multi-sig functionality for zone creation, allowing community governance or partnerships between organizations to collaboratively manage high-value locations.

## 3. **Time-Based Zone Activation**
Create scheduling system for zones that automatically activate/deactivate based on timestamps, perfect for conferences, festivals, or temporary art installations.

## 4. **NFT Staking and Rewards**
Allow users to stake their location NFTs to earn STX rewards, with higher rewards for rarer locations or complete collection sets.

## 5. **Cross-Chain Bridge Integration**
Enable bridging GeoNova NFTs to other blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon) for broader ecosystem compatibility and enhanced liquidity.

## 6. **Augmented Reality Metadata**
Extend NFT metadata to include AR content, 3D models, or interactive experiences that can be viewed when revisiting the mint location.

## 7. **Social Features and Leaderboards**
Add social proof systems with user profiles, collection showcases, location discovery leaderboards, and sharing mechanisms.

## 8. **Batch Minting for Events**
Implement batch minting functionality for large events, allowing organizers to pre-mint NFTs for attendees with proof-of-attendance verification.

## 9. **Geographic Collections and Quests**
Create collection systems where users can complete geographic challenges (visit all landmarks in a city) to unlock special rewards or rare NFTs.

## 10. **AI-Powered Location Recommendations**
Integrate AI recommendation engine that suggests new zones to visit based on user minting history, preferences, and proximity to create personalized exploration experiences.
